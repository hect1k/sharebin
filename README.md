# sharebin - Simple File, Link and Text Sharing

**sharebin** is a modern and user-focused platform built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for easy, ephemeral sharing of files, links, and text pastes. It's a *minimalist, open-source* utility built on the principle of **ephemeral data transfer**.

## Features

sharebin provides a robust set of features focusing on speed, security, and integrity:

* **Ephemeral Sharing:** Set mandatory **expiry times** on all shared items (files, text, links) to ensure automatic cleanup and minimize data retention.
* **Atomic Transactions:** Guarantees data integrity. If a file upload or email verification fails, the corresponding database record is automatically **rolled back**.
* **Background Cleanup:** Uses **`APScheduler`** to run a robust background job every minute, automatically deleting expired database records and their corresponding physical files on disk.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implements secure, IP-based rate limiting using **`slowapi`** to protect against brute-force attacks on login/registration and prevent resource exhaustion.
* **Minimalist Sharing:** File Share, URL Shortener, and Pastebin - nothing more, nothing less.
* **Anonymous-Friendly:** Excellent usage limits for anonymous sharing via the command line or web.
* **User Accounts:** Registered users gain access to custom shortcodes, extended expiry options, and history tracking.

## Philosophy

Inspired by the [suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy), sharebin is designed to be **lightweight, fast, and unbloated**. While the primary goal is simple utility, we've ensured the platform remains highly *usable* for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Running

Make sure your PostgreSQL database is running and configured correctly. Then, run the FastAPI app in development mode:

```bash
fastapi dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. The background scheduler for cleanup will start automatically.

## Docker

sharebin can be run fully containerized using Docker Compose. This simplifies deployment and ensures consistent environment configuration.

### Using Docker Compose

1.**Build and Start Containers:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

2.**Access the Application:**

```
http://localhost:8000
```

3.**Stop Containers:**

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Notes

* The `docker-compose.yml` includes services for:
  * **sharebin** (FastAPI app)
  * **postgres** (Database)
* Make sure your `.env` file is in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml` for environment variable injection.
* Storage and logs are mounted as volumes inside the container for persistence.

## Usage

### Web UI

Navigate to your domain:

```
https://shareb.in/
```

Register, log in, upload files/text pastes, and manage your shared items.

### API / CLI

The API is documented via [Redoc](https://shareb.in/redoc) and [Swagger UI](https://shareb.in/docs). CLI-friendly for power users.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://shareb.in/" -F "file=@path/to/file.txt"
```

## To-Do

* [x] Implement password reset flow.
* [x] Implement Docker support for easier deployment.
* [ ] Add file download counting and statistics.
* [ ] Optimize file cleanup frequency based on traffic.
